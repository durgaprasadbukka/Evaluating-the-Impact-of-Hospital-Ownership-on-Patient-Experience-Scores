# 🏥 Evaluating the Impact of Hospital Ownership on Patient Experience Scores

This project investigates how different types of hospital ownership (public, private nonprofit, private for-profit) affect patient satisfaction scores across 4,800+ hospitals in the U.S. We used **Python, SQL**, and **machine learning models** to analyze patterns and determine if ownership influences perceived healthcare quality.
